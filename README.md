# Treasure_Bomb_Game


Project Description:

This C program creates a small game that has hidden bombs and treasure along a path 
of variable distance.  The game requires the player to enter move location commands to reveal what is 
hidden at a given position along the path.  The object of the game is for the player to find as many 
treasures as possible before running out of moves or lives.  Discovering a bomb will reduce the player’s 
life count.  Discovering a treasure will earn the player treasure points.  Discovering both, a treasure 
with a bomb in the same location will reduce the player’s life count and earn the player treasure points 
(consider it a life insurance payout).  Prior to playing the game, the program will prompt the user to 
perform some upfront configurations to the player and the game components – these settings will 
define how the game is played.
